A Node Object performs basic calculation like addition and sunbtraction multiplication and division and when backward function of it is called it diffrentiate the action performed on variable object used by nodes object.
vairable object is the object of variable class which just store data and its diffrentiation.(node calculate answer(basic operation like add,mul,div,sub) and diffrentiation and store it in variable object).
basically i wanted to build auto diffrentiation and i am succesfull in it expect that it is not optimized.
and matrix class is for simple matrix operation on matrix of nodes object.
